## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Block project, an application designed for ESP32 microcontrollers, specifically the Lilygo T-Display S3 model. Explore the Bitcoin Timechain with a user-friendly interface displaying real-time information such as block height, transaction fees, and much more.

## Features

- **Bitcoin Information Display**: Get crucial data about the Bitcoin network, including current block height and transaction fees (low, medium, high).
- **Explore Latest Blocks**: Dive into details of the three latest blocks with an interface inspired by mempool.space.
- **Customizable Countdown**: Set up special events with a stylized countdown, as illustrated by the BEF example (18/05/2024).
- **"Limit Fees"**: Displays 2 different screens based on the chosen limit for medium fees.

## Wi-Fi Configuration

On startup, the ESP32 attempts to automatically connect to the last registered Wi-Fi network. If no network is found, it creates a Wi-Fi access point that you can connect to and configure Wi-Fi settings from your phone.
